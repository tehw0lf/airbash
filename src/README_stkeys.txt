Nothing new here, just rewritten to run on big endian systems since there
were some complaints about it not finding keys.

It generates keys between 2004/2010 but I seriously doubt any Thomson routers
were released with same algorithm after 2008
  
If compiling for big endian architectures, use -DBIGENDIAN
